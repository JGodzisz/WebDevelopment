				<h2>HTML</h2>

					<p>In our <strong>HTML</strong> section I learned many of the basic skills needed for programing web pages.<br>
				 	I learned how to use tags.  How to insert text and images into pages.  <br>
				 	We learned about applying <em>emphasis</em>, <strong>strong</strong>, and <br>
				  	line break tags.</p>

					<p>My Favorite part of <strong>HTML</strong> was creating code in notepad++ and sublime text then,<br>
					 saving it and checking how it looked when opened in different web browsers.</p>

					<p>The hardest part of <strong>HTML</strong> was learning how to organize my code<br>
					so it was not overwhelming to look at.  Also finding and using the basic set up of <br>
					<strong>HTML</strong> pages such as DOCTYPE and CHARSET= posed a challenge since it was not <br>
					reviewed in the lesson.  I also found I needed to work on better habits such as<br>
					capitalizing DOCTYPE and not <strong>HTML</strong></p>

					<p>One example of what I created with <strong>HTML</strong> is a my hobbies page.<br>
					This was part of the final project for both <strong>HTML</strong> and <em>CSS</em>.</p>

				<h2>CSS</h2>

				<p>In our <em>CSS</em> section I learned how to add style to my web pages.<br>
				Using style tags, class, and id tags I learned how to customize<br>
				a lot of elements of my pages.  I learned how <em>CSS</em> works with <strong>HTML</strong> to create<br>
				the overall look of the page.</p>

				<p>My favorite part of <em>CSS</em> was researching  new ways to style my page.  With most<br>
				reference guides you can find all kinds of new ways to be creative with each <br>
				page element.</p>

				<p>The hardest part of <em>CSS</em> was working with alignment and positioning. <br>
				I consistently wanted specific elements aligned at specific points <br>
				and learning about float properties was more advanced. However, overcoming<br>
				the challenge was very rewarding.</p>

				<p>One example of what I created with <em>CSS</em> was my blog project. I kept updating <br>
				while I learned java and really enjoyed the freedom this project gave me.</p>

				<h2>Javascript</h2>

					<p>In our <strong>Javascript</strong> lessons I learned about functions and "drawing" with code.<br>
					I learned how to animate shapes and how to use variables to make repeated <br>
					code easier to work with.</p>

					<p>My favorite part of <strong>Javascript</strong> was animation and creating my own functions. <br>
					Being able to bring your code to life is very exciting.</p>

					<p>The hardest part of learning <strong>Javascript</strong> was also animation. I struggled with <br>
					parts of animation when I created to many variables that where dependent <br>
					on other variables.</p>

					<p>One example of what I created with <strong>Javascript</strong> is my shooting star project. I felt <br>
					very accomplished with how this project turned out. I had not learned how to <br>
					draw shapes yet and used the documentation provided in Kahn Academy to figure <br>
					out how to make each shape. The comet that passes became a defining moment in <br>
					the class and my career that I will always remember.</p>

				<h2>SQL</h2>

					<p>In <em>SQL</em> I learned the Standard Query Language. This is an extremely important language<br>
					used with databases that any IT professional needs to know. I learned how to build a<br>
					simple database and how to preform and organize a query.</p>

					<p>My favorite part of <em>SQL</em> was going outside of Kahn Academy for our projects. Being able to<br>
					use another program helped me build confidence that I understood the language.</p>

					<p>The hardest part of <em>SQL</em> was remembering what to capitalize and what not to. This caused me <br>
					problems a few times during my projects. Also it is hard to retain because the <br>
					length of time spent on <em>SQL</em> was quite short.</p>

					<p>One example of what I created with <em>SQL</em> was a movie database with my favorite movies. <br>
					it was harder to pick movies than it was to build a query the database however.<br>
					Pictured is a database I created for this project.</p>
